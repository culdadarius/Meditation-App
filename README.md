# Meditation-App

Hello,

This is an application that helps with your meditation journey.
You can choose if you either want to meditate in a rainy ambiance or you want to be surrounded by the sounds of the sea and the beach.
You can choose between 3 time-lapses : 3 minutes , 5 minutes or 10 minutes.

The rainy ambiance looks like this:

You pick one of the time-lapses and hit the play button .When you do this the video in the background starts and you will feel like meditating in the rain.


And if you press the red button with the sun the application background will turn into this:
